<p>Open Airbus Cockpit is a open-source project aimed to produce software and hardware specifications to build a homemade Airbus cockpit. </p>

<p>There are some people out there who love aviation but, for one reason or other, didn't dedicate their professional life to it. But there is no reason to not become aviation as a hobby in what we call virtual aviation. We use computer-assisted simulators to enjoy the pleasure of flying. In the most simpler form, they are just computer programs controlled by a combination of keyboard, mouse and joysticks. It may become more sophisticated by adding some peripherals that simulate some aircraft systems and some other monitors to provide a wider field of view. And you may even go beyond and replicate an aircraft cockpit at home that requires almost no interaction with the computer via standard keyboard or mouse ;-)</p>

<p>Talking about cockpit building. There are some solutions in the market that provide realistic replicas of an airline cockpit, and they work very well. Unfortunately, they are too expensive for most people. A complete Airbus cockpit using such hardware may cost over 10.000€. For instance, there is a very popular replica of Airbus Flight Control Unit for around 700€. This is not an option for many people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is one alternative: make it yourself. Again, there is no chance for most people. Advanced knowledge on programming and electronics is required. That's where Open Airbus Cockpit comes into play.</p>

<p>Again, Open Airbus Cockpit provide the software and hardware specs required to build an Airbus A320 cockpit to be integrated with MS Flight Simulator. It is open, which means that all the software and specs are public. You may find them in GitHub. This means that most of the technical knowledge required to develop the solution is already made when you start building your cockpit. No programming, no circuit designing.</p>

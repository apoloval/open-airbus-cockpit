The pedestal is pretty easy to build. It is made of 16mm thick boards. You can use other thick but then you must correct the dimensions. 

After [pedestal](pedestal.html), the next natural step is to make the main deck. With main deck we mean the front structure that supports the glareshield, the MIP panels, and the pivot for the cockpit ceiling. 

This is the blueprint of the main deck structure.

The dimensions are expressed in centimeters. The parts are assembled in the joins using wood screws.

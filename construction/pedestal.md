The pedestal is pretty easy to build. It is made of 16mm thick boards. You can use other thick but then you must correct the dimensions. 

This is the blueprint of the pedestal structure.

The dimensions are expressed in centimeters. The parts are assembled in the joins using wood screws. 

Here are some pics of the assembling.

If you are a software lover, congratulations! Cockpit building is not only 
about hardware, construction, electronics, and other manual labour. Software
is a very important part of your cockpit. After all, you are making a 
simulator, not a real aircraft. And the action is in the software. 

The most obvious software part is the simulator itself. Open Airbus Cockpit
is based on Prepar3D platform, formerly known as Microsoft Flight Simulator. 
But that's not enough to have a fully simulated cockpit. In addition, you'll
need interfacing software so your hardware is able to interact with the 
simulated scene. And finally, even your hardware would require some software
to implement the logic it was designed for. 

In this section you will find relevant information that will help you to 
choice, install, configure and use the software components that will be the
heart of your cockpit.

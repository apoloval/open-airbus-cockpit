{"name":"Open Airbus Cockpit","tagline":"Blueprints, hardware specifications and software for building your homemade A320 cockpit","body":"### Welcome to Open Airbus Cockpit Project\r\n\r\nOpen Airbus Cockpit is a open-source project aimed to produce software and hardware specifications to build a homemade Airbus cockpit. \r\n\r\nThere are some people out there who love aviation but, for one reason or other, didn't dedicate their professional life to it. But there is no reason to not become aviation as a hobby in what we call virtual aviation. We use computer-assisted simulators to enjoy the pleasure of flying. In the most simpler form, they are just computer programs controlled by a combination of keyboard, mouse and joysticks. It may become more sophisticated by adding some peripherals that simulate some aircraft systems and some other monitors to provide a wider field of view. And you may even go beyond and replicate an aircraft cockpit at home that requires almost no interaction with the computer via standard keyboard or mouse ;-)\r\n\r\nTalking about cockpit building. There are some solutions in the market that provide realistic replicas of an airline cockpit, and they work very well. Unfortunately, they are too expensive for most people. A complete Airbus cockpit using such hardware may cost over 10.000€. For instance, there is a very popular replica of Airbus Flight Control Unit for around 700€. This is not an option for many people.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is one alternative: make it yourself. Again, there is no chance for most people. Advanced knowledge on programming and electronics is required. That's where Open Airbus Cockpit comes into play.\r\n\r\nAgain, Open Airbus Cockpit provide the software and hardware specs required to build an Airbus A320 cockpit to be integrated with MS Flight Simulator. It is open, which means that all the software and specs are public. You may find them in GitHub. This means that most of the technical knowledge required to develop the solution is already made when you start building your cockpit. No programming, no circuit designing.\r\n\r\n### The Big Picture\r\n\r\n#### The Hardware\r\n\r\nMost of cockpit builders are using [IOCards](http://www.opencockpits.com/index.php/en/iocards/item/Description?category_id=63) for their projects. IOCards have been a good option for many years, but as the time passes they became a little bit obsolete. Just to mention, they were designed in the times when the RS-232 was the standard for peripheral communication. With the birth of USB ports, they had to provide an auxiliary card to adapt the protocols, which are still in use today. If you want fine-grained control on the card, you have to write the firmware in assembler language or use the SIOC scripting language. \r\n\r\nAlthough IOCard may more than enough for the OAC hardware platform, [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) is a much more attractive solution. Simple, beauty, with a lively community, and a toolset that makes it possible to write a highly customized code in C++, Arduino was chosen as the hardware technology for OAC platform. \r\n\r\n#### The Software\r\n\r\n[FSUIPC](http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html) has become the standard for communicating FS/Prepar3D simulators with the outside world. The reason is simple: SimConnect, the native library provided by FS/Prepar3D SDK, is absolutely terrible. The API is event-oriented, what makes it very difficult to program when your application follows a different design approach. There is a huge inconsistency in the way the client code interacts with the state of the aircraft. E.g., some mutable variables are modified by write-variable functions, some others are modified by sending an event. \r\n\r\nIt's not surprising that most of industry left SimConnect in favor of FSUIPC. FSUIPC provides a IPC-based mechanism to communicate with the simmulator. It exposes a buffer that may be write into and read from. Each buffer element represents a simulation variable or an interface to trigger some actions. Using the read and write operations you may access or mutate bits of the state of the aircraft. So simple, so useful. \r\n\r\nOAC uses FSUIPC to communicate the simulator in two approaches.\r\n\r\n* It implements the necessary plugins in order to export the internal state of the cockpit through FSUIPC. [Wilco Exporter](https://github.com/apoloval/open-airbus-cockpit/wiki/Wilco-Exporter) is the first use case, which reads the internal variables of Wilco Airbus aircrafts and export it into FSUIPC offsets. More may come in the future, as a plugin to export Aerosoft AirbusX variables using the same offsets as Wilco Exporter does. \r\n* It implements a proxy application that takes FSUIPC to the Arduino board. Under codename `ArdUIPC`, this component provides a simple protocol on top of serial communication (USB) that receives read and write operations from the board and dispatches them through FSUIPC. \r\n\r\nUnder these two approaches, an Arduino board may read and write FSUIPC offsets that finally ends by reading from and writing into the simulated Airbus cockpit. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

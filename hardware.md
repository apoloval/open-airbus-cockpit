As you might though, almost everything in your cockpit is hardware. 
Controllers, sticks, jokes, levers, panels, indicators, displays, keyboards, 
throttles, etc. From the computer where the simulator runs to any device that 
interfaces between the pilot and the aircraft, hardware is on every corner. 

Unfortunately, most of this hardware is not off-the-shelf. Of course, the PC
where the sim runs is, as any other PC, generic. But everything else is quite
specific hardware that cannot be adquired in the corner shop. There are some 
peripherals in the market that may help, as joysticks or rudder pedals.
But even in such cases you'll have to adapt them so they are similar in their
aspect and interface to the controllers of the real cockpit. That's the easy
part. The rest of devices like panels, displays, etc, are far to be generic
and largely produced hardware that take advange of economies of scale. Although
you may find some vendors that can make plug&play replicas of the hardware,
that's probably something you cannot afford. If you are in that case, there
is only one alternative: **do it yourself**.

In this section you will find relevant information that will help you to make
all the hardware to have a complete A320 cockpit.

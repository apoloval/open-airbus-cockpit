As you might though, almost everything in your cockpit is hardware. We 
classify under this category controllers, sticks, jokes, levers, panels,
indicators, displays, keyboards, throttles, etc. Any device that interfaces
between the pilot and the aircraft is implemented in terms of hardware.

Unfortunately, most of this hardware is not off-the-shelf. You can find
some peripherals in the market that may help, as joysticks or rudder pedals.
But even in such cases you'll have to adapt them so they are similar in their
aspect and interface to the controllers of the real cockpit. That's the easy
part. The rest of derives like panels, displays, etc, are not generic
and largely produced hardware that take advange of economies of scale. Unless
you may find some vendors that can make plug&play replicas of the hardware,
that's probably something you cannot afford. If you are in that case, there
is only one alternative: **do it yourself**.

In this section you will find relevant information that will help you to make
all the hardware to have a complete A320 cockpit.

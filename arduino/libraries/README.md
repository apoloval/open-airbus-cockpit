## Introduction

This directory contains some libraries useful to implement panel logic in
Arduino boards. 

* Button: A set of classes to handle buttons, switches and other forms of
passive elements to open and close the current of a circuit. 
* OACSP: A class to send and receive OAC Serial Protocol commands using the
serial port.

LEDs.

## Installation

Just copy each directory in this folder to the 'libraries/' directory of your 
Arduino installation (e.g., `%HOMEPATH\My Documents\Arduino\libraries`).

{% include JB/setup %}

Before anything else, the cockpit needs a framework to support the rest of elements as panels, monitors, etc. The best option is to build such framework with pressed-wood boards. [Particle boards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_board) are good candidates. They are cheap and strong enough to support the weight of the whole cockpit. But you can use plywood or any other wood-based material to build the framework. 

In order to work with parts of a size we can easily handle, the structure is divided in the following sections that are assembled together after they are made.

* Central deck
* Sidestick pedestal
* Glareshield
